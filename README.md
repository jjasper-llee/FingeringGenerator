# FingeringGenerator

Program that takes in a music.xml file, scans it for notes (that appear on a specific piece) and computes the best fingering for the given notes up to fourth position according to cost tables that represent the difficulty of all the posible fingering permutations on the cello.

_I'm a cellist myself, so I am starting with the instrument I'm most familiar with. I will, of course, add other instruments later_

The system is as follows for the cello:

(Note #, Actual Note)
(0, C2)
(1, D2)
(2, E2)
(3, F2)
(4, F#2)
etc.
